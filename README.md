I'm looking for assistance to complete development on an IPTV MAC STALKER PLAYER for Windows. Currently, there's a gap in the market for a reliable MAC IPTV player on Windows, and collaborating together could transform this into a top-tier program for Windows users. If anyone is interested in contributing, it would be greatly appreciated.

The Goal is to have this player work on all Mac login iptv portals. I have the player using the VCL Player to play the files and it's free to download for anyone to use.

I hope more people pitch in this project and make this a sucesss. I havent seen anyone upload a Mac/STALKER based IPTV Player on Github.

Let's Do this....
