I'm looking for assistance to complete development on an IPTV MAC STALKER PLAYER for Windows. Currently, there's a gap in the market for a reliable MAC IPTV player on Windows, and collaborating together could transform this into a top-tier program for Windows users. If anyone is interested in contributing, it would be greatly appreciated.
